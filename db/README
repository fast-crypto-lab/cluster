For each Ubuntu 16.04 server, put a host file in the hosts/ directory

    The filename of a host file is just the hostname

    A host file should look like this:

            private-ip 10.3.2.???
            public-ip-port ???.???.???.???:????
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHjJcnsuBYh...
            ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHA...
            ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCpybp47VL...

    If the host does not have an 10.3.2.* address, the private-ip line should be

            private-ip none



For each cluster user, put a user file in the users/ directory

    The filename of a user file is just the uid and the username separated by a dash character

    A user file should look like this:

            permit-sudo no
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOQrdUdgaIc...

    If the user is permitted to run sudo, the permit-sudo line should be

            permit-sudo yes
