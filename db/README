These three files are auto-generated by ../compile

    fcl.json
    ssh_config
    ssh_known_hosts



The ../compile script parses plain text files in hosts/ and users/



For each server, you should put a host file in the hosts/ directory

    A host file should look like this:

            private-ip 10.3.2.???
            public-ip-port ???.???.???.???:????
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHjJcnsuBYh...
            ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHA...
            ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCpybp47VL...

    If the host does not have an 10.3.2.* address, the private-ip line should be

            private-ip none

    The filename of a host file is "$HOSTNAME"



For each cluster user, you should put a user file in the users/ directory

    A user file should look like this:

            permit-sudo no
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOQrdUdgaIc...

    If the user is permitted to run sudo, the permit-sudo line should be

            permit-sudo yes

    The filename of a user file is "$UID-$USER"
