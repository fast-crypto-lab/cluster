No-brainers

    Do this on new machine

        curl -fsL https://fast-crypto-lab.github.io/cluster/bootstrap | sudo bash

    Do this when you update cluster-info/hosts/ or cluster-info/users/

        cluster-info/compile

    Try to maintain a "linear" git history (when any conflict occurs, you do rebase)

How to bootstrap a new Ubuntu 16.04 server in our cluster?

    1.  log in as a user that has sudo permission

    2.  download the bootstrap script

How to generate fcl.json, ssh_config.txt, and ssh_known_hosts.txt?

    1.  update the content of cluster-info/hosts/ and cluster-info/users/

    2.  run the compile script

            ./compile

    3.  check the resulting fcl.json, ssh_config.txt, and ssh_known_hosts.txt files

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These three files are auto-generated by ../compile

    fcl.json
    ssh_config.txt
    ssh_known_hosts.txt



The ../compile script parses plain text files in hosts/ and users/



For each server, you should put a host file in the hosts/ directory

    A host file should look like this:

            private-ip 10.3.2.???
            public-ip-port ???.???.???.???:????
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHjJcnsuBYh...
            ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHA...
            ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCpybp47VL...

    If the host does not have an 10.3.2.* address, the private-ip line should be

            private-ip none

    The filename of a host file is "$HOSTNAME"



For each cluster user, you should put a user file in the users/ directory

    A user file should look like this:

            permit-sudo no
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOQrdUdgaIc...

    If the user is permitted to run sudo, the permit-sudo line should be

            permit-sudo yes

    The filename of a user file is "$UID-$USER"
