Put a host file under hosts/ for each Ubuntu 16.04 server

    The filename of a host file is just the hostname

    A host file should look like this:

            private-ip 10.3.2.???
            public-ip-port ???.???.???.???:????
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHjJcnsuBYh...
            ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHA...
            ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCpybp47VL...

    If it does not have an 10.3.2.* address, the private-ip line should be

            private-ip none


Put a user file under users/ for each fast crypto lab cluster user

    The filename of a user file is just the userid and the username

    A user file should look like this:

            permit-sudo no
            ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOQrdUdgaIc...

    If you permit the user to do sudo, the permit-sudo line should be

            permit-sudo yes
